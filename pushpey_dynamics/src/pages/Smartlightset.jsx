          <p className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-7 text-gray-300">
            The Smart Light Set is designed to revolutionize how middle- and lower-middle-class families experience lighting during power outages. It consists of multiple rechargeable lights that are controlled via a central smart remote. This setup ensures lighting in critical areas of the home like the kitchen, study, and living room without needing an inverter. For upper-class families, we will introduce a premium version with smart configurations, color lighting modes, and inverter support.
