              What is BookCollector?
            </h2>
            <p className="leading-relaxed text-base sm:text-lg text-gray-200">
              BookCollector is a sub-component of Project TATVA, designed to digitize and centralize access to school textbooks and educational materials. It replaces traditional physical books with a smart, reusable PDF reader interface. Through this system, students can carry an entire library within one device â€” enabling flexibility, sustainability, and enhanced learning.

            <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 text-green-400">Why BookCollector?</h2>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside mt-2 text-gray-200 space-y-2 text-sm sm:text-base">
              <li>Reduces school bag weight dramatically</li>
              <li>Helps preserve the environment by reducing paper usage</li>
              <li>Compatible with national curriculum updates</li>

              How it Integrates with TATVA
            </h2>
            <p className="mt-2 text-gray-200 text-sm sm:text-base">
              BookCollector seamlessly integrates with Project TATVA through a unified hardware-software ecosystem. TATVA acts as the main digital notebook, while BookCollector functions as the library unit within it. With a shared UI/UX environment, switching between note-taking and reading is frictionless. Files are synced, organized, and can even be referenced directly into notes using drag-and-drop or linking.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-2 text-gray-200 text-sm sm:text-base">
              The system uses custom-built firmware atop Raspberry Pi to access protected eBooks, and utilizes a secure cloud for school-authorized materials. Additional offline support ensures students can use it even without active internet. It also connects to TATVA's student dashboard, enabling progress tracking and integration with assignments.
